		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<div>
			<p>
				Hi.  My name is Alex Tsun, and I am currently in my first-year of undergraduate education at the University of Washington, Seattle.
			</p>

			<p>	
				My parents were and are both software engineers, and I have always been interested in what they do.  In high school, I was able to take 
				my first computer science course in my junior year, when I discovered how much I enjoyed programming.  That was when I decided I was 
				going to major in computer science.  I went on to take AP Computer Science in senior year, and have been taking computer science courses
				every quarter since the summer after that.  I even wrote two Android apps in the summer before senior year to learn about mobile 
				development and use the Java I had learned in the previous year for something different.  My app being successful made me realize
				that my code could make make other people's lives easier, and that I wanted to pursue computer science. 

			</p>

			<p>
				Ever since I was young, I have always been fascinated by mathematics and its applications to our lives today.  I have always enjoyed 
				learning about new topics in mathematics, and the best way for me to learn about the different fields of math was to participate in
				math competitions.  While preparing for the American Mathematics Competition(s), I was able to learn about fun topics such as number
				theory, probability, complex numbers, and more, which aren't taught thoroughly or at all in high school.  My favorite topic from preparing
				for these exams would have to be probability, so it is no surprise that I am planning on also majoring in mathematics and/or statistics.
