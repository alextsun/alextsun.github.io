    <p>
        Growing up in the Silicon Valley and with parents who are in the computer science field, I have always wanted to study computer science.  However, I wasn't sure I wanted to major in it until I finished my introductory programming classes in high school!  I was always interested in math, and self-studied and prepared for math competitions such as the AMC.   After taking AP Statistics as well, I found great interest in probability and data analysis.  I decided to just major in all three fields: computer science, statistics, and mathematics, because I wanted to study each further and not give any of them up.

        I have always been interested in computer or video games with CPU's which could somehow beat me, even though I had played so often.  This led me to be interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and working in these fields will definitely allow me to apply all my knowledge and work on what I really want to work on!

        I really like my first internship at BloomReach, and have definitely learned a lot of new and important computer science skills.  I hope to use these skills in conjunction with statistics and mathematics in future internships!
